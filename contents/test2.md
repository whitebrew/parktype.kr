title: 'BOLIVIA'
description: 'This typeface started as an interpretation of Albert Hollenstein’s famous «Brasilia» from 1958. A second version (G) with vertical terminals was drawn in order to let the modernistic feeling collide with a more humanistic expression. The untypical long tails of /f, /j, /r and /t are emphasized and accompanied with stylistic alternatives to give it a more contemporary feeling.'
