      <p>
        This typeface started as an interpretation of Albert Hollenstein’s
        famous «Brasilia» from 1958. A second version (G) with vertical
        terminals was drawn in order to let the modernistic feeling collide with
        a more humanistic expression. The untypical long tails of /f, /j, /r and
        /t are emphasized and accompanied with stylistic alternatives to give it
        a more contemporary feeling.
